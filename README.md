## Introduction
Over time, students at Moringa often face similar technical problems, leading to duplicated efforts in seeking solutions. This platform aims to streamline problem-solving and knowledge-sharing by providing a central repository of problems and their possible solutions. It encourages students to share, vote on, and highlight valuable answers.

## Features
The platform's Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes the following features:

1. *Authentication System:* Users can create accounts and log in to access the system.
2. *Question Creation:* Users can raise questions based on the type of problem encountered.
3. *Answering Questions:* Users can reply to posted questions with possible solutions.
4. *Voting System:* Users can vote on the suggested solutions to indicate their usefulness.
5. *Linking Similar Problems:* The system can link similar problems together for easy reference.
6. *FAQ Implementation:* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section to address common queries.
7. *Question Follow-up:* Users can mark a question and receive notifications for new answers.
8. *Notification System:* Notifications for votes, suggested answers, and responses on marked questions.



## Technogies used
- *Backend:* The backend of the application   developed using the Python flask framework.
- *Database:* PostgreSQL  used as the database management system.
- *Wireframes:* Figma  used to create the user interface prototype.
- *Frontend:* The frontend of the application is built using React.js, and state management is handled using Redux Toolkit.
